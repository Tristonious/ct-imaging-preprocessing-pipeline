# CT Imaging Preprocessing & Registration Pipeline

## Overview
This project demonstrates a simplified preprocessing and spatial registration workflow
for heterogeneous CT imaging data, representative of pipelines used in biomedical
informatics and medical imaging research.

The goal is to illustrate reproducible preprocessing, quality control, and harmonization
steps commonly required before downstream biomarker analysis.

## Data
This repository uses synthetic or publicly available example data.
No patient-identifiable or protected health information (PHI) is included.

## Methods
- Intensity normalization
- Spatial harmonization
- Quality control checks
- Example spatial alignment workflow

## Outputs
- Preprocessed CT volumes
- Diagnostic plots for quality assessment

## How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
